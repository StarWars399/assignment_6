One time I went fishing with my uncle and I was fishing and I had to set up my pole. In order for me to catch a fish I had to find out what kind of a fish I wanted and I wanted A bass. So I had to find out what type of bait a bass wanted. So I use the bait a bass wanted and I waited to I caught one. So at the end of the day I caught five and that is fishing.
